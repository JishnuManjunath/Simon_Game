This project is a recreation of the classic Simon Game, a memory-based game where players repeat increasingly complex sequences of lights and sounds. The game presents a series of tones and flashes, and the player must reproduce the sequence in the correct order. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering an engaging and interactive experience.This project is great for anyone looking to test their memory skills or enjoy a nostalgic gaming experience.
